## Example of MVVM pattern implementation.

Demo app you can play with and see some advantages of MVVM architectural pattern under the hood. This is just a very introductory look at the MVVM model. The idea behind MVVM architectural pattern is that each View on the screen will be backed by a View Model that represents the data for the View. Reduce the size of your massive View Controller by moving logic into the View Model.
